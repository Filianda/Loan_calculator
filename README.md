# Loan_calculator
Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.

## Stage 1:
### Objectives
Let's start by imitating this behavior. There are some prepared variables in the source code: these are text messages that our loan calculator can output. In this stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.
### Example
Output:
Loan principal: 1000
Month 1: repaid 250
Month 2: repaid 250
Month 3: repaid 500
The loan has been repaid!
